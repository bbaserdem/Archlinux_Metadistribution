# Server

Plans for my home server.
I want to use services on here to host my own stuff.
These are all WIP.

# Syncthing
Use syncthing as a file synching service.

# Deluge
Mostly setting up VPN-split tunneling.

So, from what I understand, I can follow [this](https://www.htpcguides.com/force-torrent-traffic-vpn-split-tunnel-debian-8-ubuntu-16-04/) guide. However, I rather use nftables, and arch wiki suggests [this](https://github.com/jonathanio/update-systemd-resolved) script for integrating openvpn and systemd-resolved. So I am on my own on this one.

# Kodi
Use this to stream media accross my devices.

# MPD
Have central access to my music collection, and stream my own music library.

# Webserver
Host a rudimentary website with blogposts and some files.
Additionally; should let me access Kodi over network.
