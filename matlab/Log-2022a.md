# MATLAB install

Notes on how I made the installer worked

# Installing 2022a

## GUI error

`./install` did not work;

```
$ ./install
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Failed to launch web window with error: Unable to launch the MATLABWindow application. The exit code was: 127
[1]    1784764 IOT instruction (core dumped)  ./install
```
Online; I was suggested to run `./bin/glnxa64/MATLABWindow` for more info;

```
$ ./bin/glnxa64/MATLABWindow
./bin/glnxa64/MATLABWindow: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libharfbuzz.so.0: undefined symbol: FT_Get_Transform
```

`FT_*` is a `freetype2` symbol apparently.
The error is due to MATLAB's freetype library can't read arch packages.
Solution is either to delete the file, or to explicitly load ours by
`LD_PRELOAD=/lib64/libfreetype.so ./install`

## Selection

From the previous list; I only had to remove Audio Toolbox.

## File Installation Key

I went to Mathworks website to generate a new key.
I figured if my computer ID is supposed to be my Ethernet MAC address;
then I can use a fake interface to share the license.
As long as I can automate a fake interface; it should work? Can't hurt to try.

Copied and pasted the key to `matlab.fik`, and moved `licence.lic` to `matlab.lic`.

## Tarball

Basically went to the installed directory, moved all files to a folder named `matlab`.

Then did `tar --create --verbose --file matlab.tar matlab`

## One-time Manual Install

Ran the installer manually to a directory called `test`; to do this I followed the PKGBUILD.

* Edited `installer_input.txt`
* Checked if spoofing a fake network would work with authentication

```
$ sudo modprobe dummy`
$ sudo ip link add eth10 type dummy`
$ sudo ifconfig eth10 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

It did not work, it is apparently checking the WiFi card for my device ID.
I added an udev rule to see if that spoofs MAC address of my main card; and that works.
***SUCCESS*** udev rules worked, and spoofing was a great success.
There is probably a way to make only matlab think this is my MAC address.
Not too worried to bother; but no two devices with the same MAC address should
be on the same network apparently; so be careful.

## OpenGL

Trying to see what works with hardware acceleration.

* Tried launching by it's own; tells me software rendering stuff.
It gives me low graphics error and that it crashed.
* Tried creating `bin/glnxa64/java.opts` with `-Djogl.disable.openglarbcontext=1`.
```

```
* Tried creating `bin/glnxa64/java.opts` with `-Djogl.disable.openglarbcontext=1`.
Exact same error as the top one
* Tried doing `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=i965 matlab`, still low level graphics error.
* Tried using the following;
```
export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libstdc++.so; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/xorg/modules/dri/; matlab
```
and I'm getting the low level crash; but no error messages on console.
* Trying i965 and the LD_PRELOAD; and the output of `opengl info` on matlab is;
```

But I did set `-nosoftwareopengl` on commandline. Here is console output;
```
libGL error: MESA-LOADER: failed to open i965: /usr/lib/dri/i965_dri.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory (search paths /usr/lib/dri, suffix _dri)
libGL error: failed to load driver: i965
```
Searched for `i965_dri.so` on the filesystem but did not find it.
* Symlinked /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 so that I don't have to type much anymore.
* Installed `vulkan-swrast`, tried launching with i965, same situation.
* Installing `llvm`, tried launching with i965, no change.
* Installing `mesa-amber`; apparently mainline removed i965. ***AAND it's working.***
* Uninstalled `vulkan-swrast` and `llvm` cause don't need them.
Here is the `opengl info` with old mesa installed
```

* Vulkan to the rescue I guess; it works when I do `MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink matlab`
I got the info from archlinux OpenGL page.
