# MATLAB install

Notes on how I made the installer worked

# Installing 2023b

There was no gui error on launching installer; installation was smooth.

## Selection

Added some toolboxes; but not much changed.

## File Installation Key

Followed mathworks instructions

Copied and pasted the key to `matlab.fik`, and moved `licence.lic` to `matlab.lic`.

## Tarball

The installer created a directory inside my target directory named `2023_04_07_15_09_13`.
I renamed this directory; and then ran `tar --create --verbose --file matlab.tar matlab`

## One-time manual install

Did this just to see if I need to change anything; but don't need to, all libraries are at the same place.

# Package build

Moved everything to a staging area (OUTSIDE OF SYNCTHING); copied the package build there and did makepkg.

Testing the package, things work well!
